# NextJS React foundations

## Chapter 1

Building blocks of a model application:
 - User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
 - Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
 - Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
 - Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
 - Integrations - what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you
 connect to them.
 - Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge).
 - Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
 - Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
 - Developer Experience - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.
